# A simple theme built on [Semantic UI](http://semantic-ui.com/collections/menu.html)

With support for:

- erb
- haml
- slim

This theme is built with accessibility in mind, using human-readable title attributes on each of the nav items.
You can also enable tooltips easily with semantic popups:

    $("a[title]").popup()
